# Wheater-App

https://joanbier.github.io/Wheater-App/

My weather aplication allows you to get weather forecast for every place in the world. It has an input to search city or 5 city buttons. There is a current, hourly(next 5h) and daily(next 7days) weather forecast. There are details (such as pressure, sunrise time, UV, wind as so on) for the current weather as well. 
The application sends a request to the Weather API server -> https://openweathermap.org/api.
